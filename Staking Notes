Staking Specs/Rules:

Each NFT staked (not the group when the stake() function is called, but each token) contains data about:
    (1) it's rarity, which determines the tierYieldBonus and
    (2) the commitment which determines commitmentYieldBonu which is only factored in reward after completed;

If you unstake/withdraw before commitment honored:
    (1) your rewards for that NFT are cut in half (lose 50%)
        (a) this implies we need to keep track of rewards for each token
            rewards[user] is the sum of rewards[tokenID] if ownerOf(tokenID) == user
