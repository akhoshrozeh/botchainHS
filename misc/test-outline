To ask:
    - Reveal timestamp?
        - should this do anything ?
        - or is it just a simple setter/getter of the bytes32 timestamp
        - should it be set only once? limited number of times?

Initial State:
    x- check name
    x- check symbol
    x- check owner
    x- check roles and role admins are set

Provenance Hash:
    x- check initially empty string
    x- can only be set once
    x- can only be set by manager

Timestamp Validation:   
    x- all can only be set by manager
    x- whitelistTS
        x- mintfromWhitelist() can only be called during then
    x- RevealTS
        x- can only be set by manager

BaseURI:
    x- can only be set by manager
    x- check all tokenURIS are baseTokenURI + tokenID
    x- changing baseuri changes baseuri for already minted tokens

Whitelist Minting:
    x- mint limit of 2
    x- token id correctly updated and assigned
    x- correct ether is being sent
    x- only manager can update whitelist root
    x- given a bytes32[] proof, verify if msg.sender is a part of the merkle tree
    x- revert if mints 1, then tries to mint 2 (and is already on whitelist)

Reserve Minting:
    x- only managers can mint reserves
    x- can only mint 100 tokens MAXIMUM
    x- tokenIDs are [5901, 6000]

Public Minting:
    x- can only mint <= 2 per call
    x- public sale must be On
    x- token values are [1,5900]
        - Note: this takes about 2 minutes to run
    x- correct ether is being sent
    x- contract balance is updated with each txn

Transfer of tokens:
    - test if accounts can successfully transfer tokens to one another
    
Withdraw contract balance:
    x- only owner can withdraw


Access Control:
    x- verify correct admins for each role
    x- verify no one can be granted/revoked owner role except owner
    x- verify no one can be granted/revoked sysadmin role except sysadmin
    x- verify no one can be granted/revoked manager role except sysadmin

    x- only owner can call withdraw
    x- only manager can call manager functions
    x- verify ownership is transferred

Public Sale:
    x- minting is stopped when sale is OFF
    x- only MANAGER can flip the sale stated
